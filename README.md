Welcome to my term project for Operating Systems 4320-15430

Deployment: https://os4320-project.fly.dev/

Included in this repository is the code written to power the app, but in order for the app to function as intended you will need to follow the deployment link above.

It is possible to run the project locally, though it would defeat the purpose of examining cloud computing protocol data as many of the calls would be to a server hosted on the local machine.

Thanks for taking a look at my work. Have a great summer!
